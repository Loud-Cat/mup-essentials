The essentials of music theory and Mup (Music Publisher)

This project is based on Alfred's Essentials of Music Theory and the Mup User's Guide.

# What is Mup?
From the [Mup Homepage](http://www.arkkra.com/index.html):

> Mup is a program for printing music. It takes an input file containing ordinary (ASCII) text describing music, and produces PostScript output for printing the musical score described by the input.

Mup is freely available for Windows, Mac OS, or Linux. To obtain a copy on your system, follow the official guide on [Obtaining a copy of Mup Version 7.2](http://www.arkkra.com/doc/obtain.html).

The sheet music and musical notation in this guide is all made using mup, with a few exceptions.
Mup files will be added to the `mups` directory of each unit when ready.
